title: "Improved performance for GitHub Actions workflows page"

description: GitHub Actions workflow pages now successfully render workflows with more than 300 jobs. We’ve implemented lazy loading to smoothly handle large workflows. In addition, you can now filter jobs based on status. This means that you can view only failed jobs or jobs in progress from the workflow pages. Screenshot of filter based on job status in the workflow page. These improvements help teams view their workflow runs, whether they’re running complex workflows with extensive job matrices or large monorepo setups.
